## Project Overview

"Welcome to the portfolio project in CS 101: Introduction to Programming! In this portfolio project, you will research, brainstorm, and build a basic terminal program of your choice for your friends and family to play with. After you finish building the program, you will create a blog post to share the program on a publication of your choice!" - [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)

### Project objectives

- Build a terminal program using Python.
- Add at least one interactive feature using input().
- Use Git version control.
- Use the command line and file navigation.
- Write a technical blog post on the project.

## Python Terminal Game: Tic-Tac-Toe

For this particular project I decided to create a tic-tac-toe game.

## Process

- Think of an idea for the python terminal game: tic-tac-toe game.
- Project brainstorming on how the game will work:
  - Game to be turn based for 2 players to play within a terminal.
  - Print out initial board game with instructions on how to play the game.
  - Get names of players and assign which player is using O (marker) and which player is using X (marker).
  - Play starts with each player taking turns stating location of where to place their marker.
  - After each turn, reprint board game to show where the placed markers are.
  - Check for when 3 matching markers are either in a row, column, or along a diagonal.
  - If yes:
    - Print winner information.
  - Elseif all locations on board are full:
    - Print draw information.
  - Else:
    - Next player takes their turn.
  - Get whether players wish to play another round of the game and reset game if yes.
  - Keep total score for each player when playing multiple rounds of the game.
- Set up a GitHub repository.
- Set up Git version control.
- TODO: Write tic-tac-toe game program.
- TODO: Refactor program.
- TODO: Create blog post about project. (This README file is my post about the project I have created.)

### Built with

Python utilising:
